<h5>What is the focus of iOS Conf SG - 2020?</h5> <br />
SwiftUI and Combine are two big announcements by Apple this year. We'll have some talks related to practical applications of these technologies. However, the main focus of the conference is still to provide tools and techniques to iOS developers that they can use to build mobile applications with the highest quality. <br /> <br />
We try not to keep too many beginner talks and emphasize more on knowledge sharing based on the expertise of the speakers.
<br /> <br />

<h5>What's the best way to reach to the conference venue?</h5><br />
iOS Conf SG - 2020 will be at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Bw9oiRRdwoZLG5FC8" target="blank">Shaw Foundation Alumni House</a><br /> <br />

<h5>What do I get for each conference ticket?</h5><br />
Access to the two-day conference and includes breakfasts, lunches and refreshments.<br />
We also have swag such as T-Shirt (and more), and the After Party on 18th Jan (Saturday evening at 6:30 pm).<br /><br />

<h6>Tickets for workshop is sold separately.</h6><br /> <br />

<h5>Can I buy one day ticket (i.e. for 17th Jan or 18th Jan only)?</h5><br />
Sorry, we do not sell one-day tickets because of logistical challenges. <br /> <br />

<h5>Why are workshop tickets sold seperately?</h5><br />
There are limited seats for workshops to make it easier for both the participants and the speakers to get the best out of the workshops.<br/>
We need to book the venue and arrange logistics for workshops separately.<br/><br/>

<h5>Can I buy one day ticket for the workshop (i.e. for 15th Jan or 16th Jan only)?</h5><br />
Sorry, we do not sell one-day tickets because of logistical challenges. <br /> <br />

<h5>I am a student and want to attend the conference but I cannot afford to buy a ticket. Are there any tickets for students?</h5><br />
This year we don't have any special student discount. However, we have a group discount when 3 or more tickets are purchased together. Kindly contact us to know more.<br /> <br />

<h5>What is the cancellation and refund policy?</h5><br />
