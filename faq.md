<b>What is the focus of iOS Conf SG - 2020?</b> <br />
SwiftUI and Combine are two big announcements by Apple this year. We'll have some related to practical applications of these technologies. However, the main focus of the conference is still to provide tools and techniques to iOS developers that they can use to build mobile applications with the highest quality. <br /> <br />
We try not to keep too many beginner talks and emphasize more on knowledge sharing based on the expertise of the speakers.
<br /> <br />

<b>What's the best way to reach to the conference venue?</b><br />
Venue will be announced closer to the conference.<br /> <br />

<b>What do I get for each conference ticket?</b><br />
Access to the two-day conference and includes breakfasts, lunches and refreshments.<br />
We also have swag such as T-Shirt (and more), and the After Party on 18th Jan (Saturday evening at 6:30 pm).<br /><br />

* Do note that you have to be of legal drinking age to attend the After Party. <br /> <br />
<strong>Tickets for workshop is sold separately.</strong><br /> <br />

<b>Can I buy one day ticket (i.e. for 17th Jan or 18th Jan only)?</b><br />
Sorry, we do not sell one-day tickets because of logistical challenges. <br /> <br />

<b>Why are workshop tickets sold seperately?</b><br />
There are limited seats for workshops to make it easier for both the participants and the speakers to get the best out of the workshops.<br/>
We need to book the venue and arrange logistics for workshops separately.<br/><br/>

<b>Can I buy one day ticket for the workshop (i.e. for 15th Jan or 16th Jan only)?</b><br />
Sorry, we do not sell one-day tickets because of logistical challenges. <br /> <br />
We're giving the bundle ticket with a huge discount. So you might consider it to get the best out of the conference.

<b>I am a student and want to attend the conference but I cannot afford to buy a ticket. Are there any tickets for students?</b><br />
This year we don't have any special student discount. However, if you have attended iOS Conf SG twice before then, you're qualified to get a discount of 20% that Subh announced earlier this year. Please contact us and we'll share more details.<br /> <br />

<b>What is the cancellation and refund policy?</b><br />
We do not allow cancellation of tickets for iOS Conf SG. However, you can transfer your ticket to someone else if you are not able to attend the conference. Kindly contact the organizers who can help you with this. <br /> <br />

<b>When can I find the complete list of talks?</b><br />
The agenda will be updated on our website closer to the date. You are encouraged to register early to get super early-bird and early-bird discounts. <br /> <br />

<b>Is there a group discount?</b><br />
Drop us an email for the group discount.<br/><br/>

<b>What are the sponsorship opportunities?</b><br />
We are looking for sponsors! <a href="mailto:subh@iosconf.sg">Contact Subh</a> if you are interested. <br /> <br />
