<b>What is the focus of iOS Conf SG - 2019?</b> <br />
This year's conference is going to be focused mainly on improving the quality and performance of an iOS application. Starting from modern architecture patterns to the latest Swift features - we'll try to have a fun-filled two days conference. For this year we are not having too many beginner talks.<br /> <br />

<b>What's the best way to reach to the conference venue?</b><br />
<strong>Matrix at Biopolis</strong> is at a walk-in distance from Buona Vista MRT station.
From Exit D at Buona Vista Station, it is a short walk to the event venue.<br /> <br />

<b>What do I get for each conference ticket?</b><br />
Access to the two-day conference and includes breakfasts, lunches and refreshments.<br />
We also have swag such as T-Shirt (and more), and the After Party on 20 Jan.<br />

* Do note that you have to be of legal drinking age to attend the After Party. <br /> <br />
* Tickets for workshop is sold separately.<br /> <br />

Sorry, we do not sell one-day tickets because of logistical challenges. <br /> <br />

<b>I am a student and want to attend the conference but I cannot afford to buy a ticket. Are there any tickets for students?</b><br />
This year we don't have any special student discount. If you have pre-registered for the conference you will get an email to purchase super-early bird ticket at a discounted price. <br /> <br />

<b>What is the cancellation and refund policy?</b><br />
We do not allow cancellation of tickets for iOS Conf SG. However, you can transfer your ticket to someone else if you are not able to attend the conference. Kindly contact the organizers who can help you with this. <br /> <br />
